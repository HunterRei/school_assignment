            <h2>Something Interesting About Me</h2>
            <p>Something interesting about me would have to be the fact that I like/enjoy getting up at 4:30 every morning. Alot of my friends think I am crazy for this but my dad always got me up super early as a kid and therefore I have been the same and don't really think that will change all that much.</p>
